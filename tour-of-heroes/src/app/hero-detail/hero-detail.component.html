<!--
    we split the hero details into its own seperate component so that the heroes component 
    isnt handling displaying all of the content
-->

<!--
    we want to let users edit the names of the heroes in a way that will update the hero.name as it is being typed in
    so we set up a two way binding in the way of [(ngModel)]="hero.name" so that data can flow from the hero.name property to the text box and from
    the text box back to the hero.name
-->
<div *ngIf="hero">

    <h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
    <div>id: {{hero.id}}</div>
    <div>
        <label for="name">Hero name: </label>
        <input id="name" [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
    </div>

</div>
